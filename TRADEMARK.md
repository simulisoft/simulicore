# Trademark Policy

**Version:** 1.0  
**Last Updated:** December 27, 2025

This policy outlines the rules for using the trademarks associated with the **Simulisoft** initiative. Our goal is to encourage widespread use of our software while ensuring users can identify official versions of our projects.

## 1. Scope of the Policy
This policy covers the following marks (collectively referred to as "the Marks"):
*   **Simulisoft** (Initiative name and brand)
*   **SimuliCore** (The core open source software engine)
*   **CLA3P** (SimuliCore main linear algebra module)
*   **CMPI** (SimuliCore Message Passing Interface C++ utilities)
*   **cuLite** (SimuliCore Lightweight interface for gpu acceleration using NVIDIA&reg; CUDA&reg;)

## 2. Trademarks and Open Source Licensing
The **SimuliCore** software and its sub-modules (**CLA3P**, **CMPI**, and **cuLite**) are licensed under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](www.apache.org). 

**Important:** As stated in Section 6 of the Apache License, Version 2.0, the license does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, **except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.** This Trademark Policy governs your use of the Marks in accordance with the Apache License and provides additional guidance on permitted and prohibited uses.

## 3. Permitted Uses
You may use the Marks without prior written permission for the following purposes:
*   **Reasonable and Customary Use:** As permitted under Section 6 of the Apache License, Version 2.0, you may use the Marks as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
*   **Factual Statements:** To truthfully describe your software’s relationship with our projects (e.g., "This plugin is compatible with SimuliCore" or "Our platform utilizes the cuLite sub-module").
*   **Linking:** To link to the official Simulisoft repositories or website.
*   **Educational Use:** In research papers, articles, or presentations that discuss the software, provided the use does not imply an official endorsement.

## 4. Prohibited Uses
To protect the integrity of the initiative, you may **not**:
*   Use the Marks as part of your own product, service, or company name.
*   Use the Marks in a way that suggests Simulisoft endorses, sponsors, or is affiliated with your project without express written consent.
*   Register domain names, social media handles, or trademarks that are confusingly similar to the Marks.
*   **Forking and Renaming:** If you modify SimuliCore or its sub-modules (a "fork") and distribute it, you must:
    *   Retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work as required by the Apache License.
    *   Use the Marks only as necessary to reasonably describe the origin of your Derivative Work (e.g., "based on SimuliCore" or "derived from CLA3P").
    *   Use a distinct name for your version to avoid user confusion regarding the source and official status of the software.
    *   Not use the Marks as the primary name or branding of your modified version.

## 5. Visual Guidelines
When using the Marks, please ensure they are:
*   Used as adjectives, not nouns (e.g., "The SimuliCore software" rather than "using SimuliCore").
*   Spelled correctly with the proper capitalization (e.g., **SimuliCore**, **CLA3P**, **CMPI**, **cuLite**).

## 6. Trademark Attribution
Where appropriate, please include the following attribution statement in your documentation:
> *"Simulisoft, SimuliCore, CLA3P, CMPI, and cuLite are trademarks of the Simulisoft initiative."*

## 7. Reservation of Rights
Except as expressly permitted under Section 6 of the Apache License, Version 2.0, or as specifically authorized by this Policy, all rights to the Marks are reserved by the Simulisoft initiative. Simulisoft reserves the right to review all use of the Marks and to take appropriate action regarding uses that fall outside the scope of the Apache License and this Policy. This Policy does not grant any right or license to any other intellectual property of the Simulisoft initiative beyond what is expressly provided in the Apache License, Version 2.0.

## 8. Questions and Permissions
If you wish to use the Marks in a manner not covered by this policy, or to report unauthorized use, please contact the maintainers via the [SimuliCore Project GitHub](https://github.com/simulisoft/simulicore).
